# WildStorage
This is a save editor for ACWW which runs on the DS. Its main purpose is to provide extra space to store items and patterns, but it can also do general save editing and cheat stuff too. It can work on saves that are already on the flashcart, and it _should_ work on real ACWW cartridges, but this has not been fully tested.

Item management features:
* Edit inventories, mail presents, wardrobes/closets, lost and found, recycler, Nook's shop
* Move items between different areas
* Add whatever items you want into inventories (including unused/glitchy ones), or copy them
* Item sorting
* Extra space to store 4500 items per-town, stored outside of the savefile

Pattern management features:
* Move patterns between the players, Able Sisters, villagers, the flag, and Blanca
* Will update patterns placed on the map when you swap patterns between players

* Make Resetti not appear
* Remove weeds
